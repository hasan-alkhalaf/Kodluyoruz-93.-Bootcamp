            <p><strong>Katmer</strong> is another delicious dessert that native to Gaziantep city of Turkey. It is a crisp phyllo dough dessert which contains pistachios and clotted cream in it. Gaziantep city locals start the day with this dessert. They prefer to eat it at breakfast because pistachio nuts increase energy level and reduce morning fatigue. There are some small shops in Gaziantep city that only serves <strong>Katmer</strong> for breakfast.</p>
            <h1>The Tradition.</h1>
            <p>
This dessert is one of the ancient dessert variety of Turkish cuisine. It has been in our culture more than 500 years. This delicious dessert is also known as ‘Damat Katmeri’, in English ‚‘Groom Katmer’.

We call it ‘Damat Katmeri’ because the father of the Groom sends Katmer dessert to the newlyweds and the bride’s father’s house on the first morning of the wedding to show that he wishes a sweet marriage as Katmer dessert to the newlyweds and let them to refresh quickly after the wedding ceremony fatigue.

I believe cultural traditions are very important and meaningful for every country. Traditions unite people and thank god we have many meaningful traditions in our country.

<h1>Where to eat Katmer in Gaziantep?
</h1>
<p>
    There are many patisseries or restaurants in Gaziantep city that offer <strong>Katmer</strong> dessert in their menu; however, my personal preference is to eat it at Katmer shops. The one that I like most called ‘Katmerci Zekeriya Usta‘. It is by far the best Katmer shop that I know at Gaziantep city.
</br>
</br>
    If you ever come to visit Gaziantep city, don’t forget to stop by at this little shop. The shop has been in this business since 1925. Today the second generation is managing the shop and the owner is very good at making this delicious dessert. Katmer dessert usually serves in two shapes. It is either Square shape or Simit shape.

            <p>This little Katmer shop is offering the both classic Square shape Katmer and Simit shape Katmer. In terms of taste, they are both same. The only difference is their look. If you are in a rush and don’t have time to sit and eat, you can go with Simit shape Katmer. It is much more convenient to eat Simit shape one while you are walking to the office</p>
